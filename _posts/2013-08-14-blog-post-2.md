Our team is developing a benchtop automation device to replace the operator‑dependent oil‑fill and purge process used in KLX’s Measurement‑While‑Drilling (MWD) tools. The device must integrate with the existing bench station, clamp the pulser securely, and execute a validated vacuum/pressure cycle with repeatable accuracy. The design is constrained by weight, accuracy, cycle time, and safety requirements, all while fitting within the existing workstation footprint


### Table of Constraints

| Parameter | Description | Target Specification |
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|
| Dimensions    | Length should be no more than existing standard sizes of automated arms for the support load.    | Arm's length under 7 feet    |
| Operator access/clearance  | Maintain a buffer so the technician can reach valves/lines without obstruction during and after a cycle.    |  ≥ 12 [in] operator clearance in the active zone; ≥ 6 [in] buffer from bench edge/pegboard along the motion path.    |
| Required degrees of freedom    | Provide vertical translation for lift and rotation about the tool for agitation.    | 2 DoF — vertical lift + roll    |
| Lift performance   | Arm should raise pulser high enough for the tubing to stay above the oil reservoir.   | Minimum of 18 inches    |
|-----------------------------|
| Positional accuracy  | Arm must reach the target fill position consistently.   | Linear within 0.2 [in] angular within 3 degrees |
| Park (neutral) position   | When parked, the clamp mount elevation relative to the bench top preserves hose reach and operator access.   | Clamp mount ≤ 4 in above bench top in park position; no hose interference.   |
