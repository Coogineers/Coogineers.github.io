Our team is developing a benchtop automation device to replace the operator‑dependent oil‑fill and purge process used in KLX’s Measurement‑While‑Drilling (MWD) tools. The device must integrate with the existing bench station, clamp the pulser securely, and execute a validated vacuum/pressure cycle with repeatable accuracy. The design is constrained by weight, accuracy, cycle time, and safety requirements, all while fitting within the existing workstation footprint

### Table of Constraints

| Parameter | Description | Target Specification |
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|
| Dimensions    | Length should be no more than existing standard sizes of automated arms for the support load.    | Arm's length under 7 feet    |
| Operator access/clearance  | Maintain a buffer so the technician can reach valves/lines without obstruction during and after a cycle.    |  ≥ 12 [in] operator clearance in the active zone; ≥ 6 [in] buffer from bench edge/pegboard along the motion path.    |
| Required degrees of freedom    | Provide vertical translation for lift and rotation about the tool for agitation.    | 2 DoF — vertical lift + roll    |
| Lift performance   | Arm should raise pulser high enough for the tubing to stay above the oil reservoir.   | Minimum of 18 inches    |
|-----------------------------|
| Positional accuracy  | Arm must reach the target fill position consistently.   | Linear within 0.2 [in] angular within 3 degrees |
| Park (neutral) position   | When parked, the clamp mount elevation relative to the bench top preserves hose reach and operator access.   | Clamp mount ≤ 4 in above bench top in park position; no hose interference.   |
|=============================|
| Load capacity   | It must support the weights of the pulser, clamp and adapter.    | Greater than or equal to 40 lbs static load    |
| Moment capacity   | Must withstand the bending moment created by the load.   | 40 lbs load at maximum 13 inch offset ≈ 5,200 lb-in   |
| Workspace range   | Arm must operate within the fixed bench area without interfering with tubing.    | Less than 64 x 58 x 24 inches   |
| Safety Factor    | Structural components must lift and rotate during motion and stopping.   | Minimum of 3   |
| Clamp integration  | Bolt the grippers base to the systems rigid plate on the carriage arm.   | No more than 13 inches from the jaw center to the mount center   |
| Power loss | Must have a controlled descent   | No free falling   |
| Emergency stop  | Remove power and engage brake instantly   | Accessible to operator   |

## Constraint challenges to our design 

  * Weight vs. footprint: Supporting a 40 lb pulser within a 64 × 48 in bench space forces us to rethink how we distribute loads and control motion. Figure 1 below, shows the pulser rod lifted onto the work bench to elevate the pulser fill hole above the degassing chamber.
  * Lift and alignment: Achieving an 18 in vertical stroke with ±0.1 in positional accuracy means our actuator must be both powerful and precise with small room for drift or backlash. Figure 2 below is an example of a technician rolling the pulser rod to assist the movement of trapped air pockets.
  * Cycle time pressure: KLX’s standards push us to reduce fill/purge time without compromising safety or validation.
  * Safety envelope: Maintaining 12 in of operator clearance while routing hoses and avoiding kinks adds spatial complexity.

## Our technical analysis plan 
Before we build anything, we’re running a full suite of simulations and validations to make sure our concept can handle the job:
* Stress and fatigue modeling: We’re using hand calculations and FEA to validate structural integrity under static and dynamic loads.
* Motion profile analysis: MATLAB simulations help us tune actuator speed, displacement, and repeatability across ≥20 cycles.
* Tolerance stack-up studies: We’re mapping clamp geometry and pulser alignment to ensure sealing reliability and avoid misfires.
* Cycle timing simulations: We’re modeling valve sequencing and dwell periods to hit the 20-minute cycle time and stretch toward 5 minutes.
* Verification matrix: Every spec in our table is linked to a measurable test, so we can trace performance directly to design intent.

## What We’re Measuring:
* Deflection under load
* Positional and angular repeatability
* Pressure/vacuum dwell stability
* Hose clearance and routing
* Cycle time vs. throughput targets
These metrics will tell us whether our design is ready for KLX’s bench and whether it can scale beyond.

### Additional Soft Challenges to Solve

---

#### 1. Traceability & Quality Control  
KLX needs to verify that each cycle was completed correctly and safely.  
- **Challenge**: How to integrate traceable data logging without overwhelming the operator?  
- **Design Feature**: Embedded sensors with timestamped logs and auto-generated cycle reports.  
- **Success Metric**: Every cycle produces a pass/fail record linked to the pulser.

---

#### 2. Validation Under Real Conditions  
KLX’s bench conditions for field validations
- **Challenge**: How to ensure the system performs reliably with vibration?  
- **Design Feature**: Tolerance for minor misalignment.  
- **Success Metric**: ≥20 cycles completed under working conditions with no drift.

---

#### 3. Scalability & Future Adaptation  
KLX might want to replicate or upgrade this system later.  
- **Challenge**: How will we design for future pulser models, new stations, or automation upgrades?  
- **Design Feature**: Modular architecture and adjustable clamp geometry. 
- **Success Metric**: System can be adapted to a new pulser model.
