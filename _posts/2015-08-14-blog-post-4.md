For the work period of Nov 15 - Nov 29 our team focused heavily on our technical analysis. We completed calculations for the requirements of our motors to aid in the creation of our Bill of Materials (BOM).

The calculations done were used to derive our torque and lift requirements which gave us our necessary motor specs. From there we began to work backwords and buy components that will fulfill the needs of our selected motors, and created our BOM.

After completing the BOM, our team began to layout our components and design a wiring schematic to ensure we have all the necessary hardware to safely run our equipment.

In parallel one of our team members worked on performing Finite Element Analysis on some of the load bearing components of our design to ensure that our components will be able to withstand the load exerted by our automated oil fill process.

The final device is a bench-mounted oil-fill agitator with 3-DoF: vertical (PA-18, ~16 in travel), roll and tilt (ClearPath + planetary gearboxes) with a quick-release, anti-slip clamp. Control is handled by a ClearCore controller with E-stop, interlock, current limits, and software travel limits. It delivers hands-free agitation, repeatable alignment, safe operation, and rapid changeover.
