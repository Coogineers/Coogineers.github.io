For the work period of Nov 15 - Nov 29 our team focused heavily on our technical analysis. We completed calculations for the requirements of our motors to aid in the creation of our bom.

The calculations done were used to derive our torque and lift requirements which gave us our necessary motor specs. From there we began to work backwords and buy components that will fulfill the needs of our selected motors, and created our bill of materials (BOM).

After completing the BOM, our team began to layout our components and design a wiring schematic to ensure we have all the necessary hardware to safely run our equipment.

In parallel one of our team members worked on performing Finite Element Analysis on some of the load bearing components of our design to ensure that our components will be able to withstand the load exerted by our automated oil fill process.
