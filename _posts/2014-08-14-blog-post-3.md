Two more design concepts were drafted for automated agitation. Among the four drafted designs the team chose to move along with the vertical rack and pinion lift. This will use rack and pinion actuators for vertical motion a step motor for roll and a cable drum winch for a 45 degree tilt axis. Next gear ratios were calculated for the stepper motor.

Next steps include finding a desired rack speed, availability on supply voltage, and any motor mounting constraints.

The team hopes to build bench mockups and run hose safety checks to verify we selected the best concept. We also must select controller, electronic components, and materials. We plan to have FEA on the designed structured. The team also plans to build a control program, wiring diagram and safety chain for emergency stops. The procurement list will follow as well as reaching our design freeze and sign off.

We acknowledge there may be some challenges with the path of motion and hose bend radius. We plan to find the worst position that puts the hose at risk during mockups and reroute hoses.
Next we suspect the lift torque margin may be insufficient. We will use a conservative inertia and friction then select the next-size actuator and brake.
The roll torque or brake hold could be inadequate. We plan to select a brake with 1.5x minimum hold to the worst torque and add detent.
Another obstacle includes safety relays or the emergency stop wiring is noncompliant. The team will follow a wiring checklist, find peer reviews, and plan a bench test.
Long lead motors drive or brake delay procurement can be affected from limited stock and holiday lead times therefore we plan to identify two vendors each, have RFQ’s early, and approve any alternatives.

The following key positions were defined. In the parked position, Figure 1a, a technician manually re-orients the pulser to the agitate position, Figure 1b, where they rattle the tool to dislodge residual (entrained) air while allowing vacuum to build.  The technician then re-orientates the pulser to the purge position, Figure 1c, to allow for the entrained air to escape.
