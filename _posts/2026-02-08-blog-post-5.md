## Jan 19 – Feb 8 (what we got done + what’s in progress)

During this stretch we focused on getting everything “real-world verified” so the build doesn’t get derailed later. We inventoried and checked all received parts against the BOM, took fit-critical measurements on delivered components, and then used those as-built measurements to update the CAD. The final gearbox has already arrived, been inspected/checked, and with the CAD locked in, our prints have been finalized as well. At this point, all purchased components are in-hand, and we also built the mobile workstation so we can test and program the electronics before the final installation at KLX.

## Feb 8 – Feb 22 (near-term plan + milestones)

Over the next two weeks we’ll push hard on controls integration and first motion. We’ll finalize the wiring diagrams and harness plan, lock the controller I/O map and safety-chain interface, and start wiring/coding the electrical components on the mobile workstation so we can do a controlled bring-up before everything is permanently installed. We’ll also purchase the remaining “small but necessary” hardware—nuts, bolts, washers, ball bearings—so assembly isn’t held up by basic parts. In parallel, we plan to start testing the IMU and building familiarity with the device early, so it’s ready when we start collecting validation data. The milestone for this window is to have at least one axis operational by the end of the period.

## Next two weeks (obstacles + solutions + backup plans)

The main risk is still wiring and integration mistakes that could damage expensive components (especially during first power-up and motion testing). To reduce that risk, we’re doing staged bring-up with checks at each step (continuity/verification before power, then incremental testing) and getting guidance from experienced resources where possible (engineer support, EE lab contacts, IEEE). On the validation side, IMU setup and data quality could take longer than expected, so we’re starting IMU testing now to de-risk it, and we’re keeping a backup option of using higher-precision measurement tools (like a CMM) if we need tighter confirmation on critical motion or geometry.
