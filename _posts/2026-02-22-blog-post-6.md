## Feb 9th - Feb 22nd (Completed and/or In Progress Tasks)
During this period, we completed the inspection of the final gearbox upon its arrival. While the custom parts are currently being machined and are expected to be finished by the end of February, we began assembling the electronic components. The team discovered that the motors we ordered do not include adapter cables compatible with our ClearCore motor controllers. We are in the process of placing a second purchase order for missing components such 8pin (4+4) cables, 12V power supply, higher rating fuses and electrical housing box. As our expenses start to approach the budget, we are extra cautious with our spending to keep the cost low.

## Feb 23rd - Mar 15th (Near-Term Plan and Milestone)
We will perform a final inspection of the machined parts to ensure all tolerances meet specifications before proceeding with assembly and installation. This will be followed by a bench mounting and alignment verification on the mock up station. The team will continue to collaborate on the control programming shared on GITHUB along doing wirings and properly intergrating electrical component inside the enclosure, ensuring proper cable management for organization and protection. Finally, we will verify safety features are working and test the combined motion sequences in slow speed. 

## Next two weeks (Obstacles + Solutions + Backup plans)
When installing the control enclosure, and routing the harness, limited space, overheating risks, or interference between power and signal wiring may occur. Planning the layout in advance, separating high-current and signal lines, and providing ventilation or cooling will help prevent these problems; if needed, a larger enclosure or external cooling can be implemented. Cable management challenges such as strain during motion, electrical noise, or limited maintenance access can be mitigated through the use of strain reliefs, cable carriers, proper routing practices, and clear labeling, with quick-disconnects or additional supports available as alternatives.

During controller setup, incorrect motor parameters, communication errors, or firmware conflicts may arise. These can be resolved by verifying wiring and configurations, using manufacturer setup tools, and performing incremental testing; backup plans include reloading configurations, testing with known working components, or consulting technical support. Safety verification may reveal issues such as improper emergency stop function, unguarded pinch points, or overheating risks. Testing safety circuits under load, installing guards, and confirming proper fuse and thermal protection ratings will reduce hazards, while redundant safety devices and software motion limits can provide additional protection. Finally, when testing combined motion sequences, potential collisions, synchronization errors, or vibration may occur. Running low-speed tests, tuning motion parameters, and monitoring structural behavior will help ensure smooth operation, with limit switches, sequence adjustments, or structural reinforcement available if further refinement is required
