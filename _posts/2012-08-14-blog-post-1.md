In Measurement While Drilling (MWD) systems, dielectric oil is used to fill an internal chamber within a pulser to protect sensitive electronics and balance pressure across seals during downhole operations. At KLX Energy Services, this process is currently performed manually. A technician connects an adapter, draws a vacuum to remove trapped air, cycles pressure several times to eliminate residual bubbles, and finally installs an oil fill plug to seal the chamber. While effective, the process is highly dependent on the operator, time consuming and prone to inconsistencies. Any trapped air can compromise tool reliability leading to shortening lifespan in field operations.

The risks associated with air in hydraulic oil are well documented. Entrained bubbles degrade lubricity, lower thermal conductivity, and increase the likelihood of cavitation erosion, all of which destabilize performance and raise maintenance costs [1]. Methods that remove or suppress bubbles extend oil life, improve stability, and reduce damage [1]. At the same time, the industry is embracing digitalization and automation to address inefficiencies, reduce operator dependence, and improve repeatability. Automated systems and real-time control have already improved drilling consistency, reduced risk, and lowered costs [2].

Our project applies these same principles to the oil-fill process. By automating the procedure, we aim to reduce cycle time, improve consistency across multiple runs, and eliminate human error in bubble removal. These challenges represent the technical heart of our project and define the key milestones for success.
