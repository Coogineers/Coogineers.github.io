In Measurement While Drilling (MWD) systems, dielectric oil is used to fill an internal chamber within a pulser to protect sensitive electronics and balance pressure across seals during downhole operations. At KLX Energy Services, this process is currently performed manually. A technician connects an adapter, draws a vacuum to remove trapped air, cycles pressure several times to eliminate residual bubbles, and finally installs an oil fill plug to seal the chamber. While effective, the process is highly dependent on the operator, time consuming and prone to inconsistencies. Any trapped air can compromise tool reliability leading to shortening lifespan in field operations.

In a study to investigate how entrained air bubbles in oil accelerate degradation, reduce lubricity, and increase cavitation erosion, professors at Hosei University verified that in a 456-hour pump test, oil with trapped air showed a rise in total acid number (TAN) beyond acceptable limits, while oil with bubble elimination remained stable. This directly supports the need for consistent oil-fill quality in systems like MWD pulsers 1.
