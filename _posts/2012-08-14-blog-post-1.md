In Measurement While Drilling (MWD) systems, dielectric oil is used to fill an internal chamber within a pulser to protect sensitive electronics and balance pressure across seals during downhole operations. At KLX Energy Services, this process is currently performed manually. A technician connects an adapter, draws a vacuum to remove trapped air, cycles pressure several times to eliminate residual bubbles, and finally installs an oil fill plug to seal the chamber. While effective, the process is highly dependent on the operator, time consuming and prone to inconsistencies. Any trapped air can compromise tool reliability leading to shortening lifespan in field operations.

The risks associated with air in hydraulic oil are well documented. Entrained bubbles degrade lubricity, lower thermal conductivity, and increase the likelihood of cavitation erosion, all of which destabilize performance and raise maintenance costs [1]. Methods that remove or suppress bubbles extend oil life, improve stability, and reduce damage [1]. At the same time, the industry is embracing digitalization and automation to address inefficiencies, reduce operator dependence, and improve repeatability. Automated systems and real-time control have already improved drilling consistency, reduced risk, and lowered costs [2].

Our project applies these same principles to the oil-fill process. By automating the procedure, we aim to reduce cycle time, improve consistency across multiple runs, and eliminate human error in bubble removal. These challenges represent the technical heart of our project and define the key milestones for success.

Our team is addressing the problem of manually filling MWD pulsers with dielectric oil, a process that currently takes about 20 minutes per tool and depends heavily on operator judgment. This manual approach often leaves trapped air inside the pulser, reducing seal reliability and shortening tool life. 

Our goal is to design an automated system that can reduce cycle time to 15 minutes or less in 95% of cases, while safely handling a 30-lb pulser with a structural safety factor of at least 2.0. The system must also maintain precise pressure control, reaching 30 psi ±2 psi with a ramp rate of 0.5–2 psi/s, limiting overshoot to no more than 31.5 psi, and holding stable with ≤0.1 psi/s drift over 60 seconds. 

We are focusing on this issue because improving the consistency of the oil-fill process will directly reduce downtime, improve tool reliability, and free technicians for higher-value work. These performance targets form the basis of our engineering goals and will guide both our design decisions and our validation testing as the project moves forward.

As our team begins developing the automated oil-fill system for MWD pulsers, we recognize that solving this problem will not be straightforward. The first challenge is replicating the manual vacuum-and-pressurization process in a way that consistently removes trapped air. In the field, technicians often rely on their own judgment, making small adjustments as needed. Automating this means designing a control system that can respond dynamically to pressure data without human intuition, which will require precise sensors and well-tuned algorithms.

Another major obstacle lies in the mechanics of the articulating arm. The arm must reliably position and hold the adapter in place while handling the 30-pound pulser. Achieving both accuracy and durability will require careful CAD modeling, motion analysis, and eventually finite element analysis (FEA) to ensure the arm can withstand repeated loading. Fatigue from repeated cycles could become a weak point if not addressed early.

Integration also presents difficulties. Our design must connect seamlessly with KLX’s existing pump and compressed air systems. This means our system cannot be an isolated prototype. We’ll need to think carefully about how the fittings, valves, and wiring fit together, making sure there’s enough bench space so nothing gets in the way or creates safety issues.

We know these challenges will demand creativity, careful engineering, and persistent problem solving. But addressing them head-on is what makes this project both demanding and exciting.
