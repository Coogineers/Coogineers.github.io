In Measurement While Drilling (MWD) systems, dielectric oil is used to ﬁll an internal chamber within a pulser to protect sensitive electronics and balance pressure across seals during downhole operations. At KLX Energy Services, this process is currently performed manually. A technician cycles pressure several times to eliminate residual bubbles using an MWD tool assembly. Finally, they install an oil ﬁll plug to seal the chamber. While eﬀective, the process is highly dependent on the operator, time consuming and prone to inconsistencies. Any trapped air can compromise tool reliability leading to shortening lifespan in ﬁeld operations. 

Our project aims to design and build an automated system for the oil-ﬁlling process that integrates with the company’s existing vacuum-ﬁll infrastructure to perform this process more consistently and eﬃciently. Using a programmable articulating arm and an integrated control system, the device will replicate the manual procedure by following a programmed sequence, including drawing vacuum, controlled pressurization, and reorientation of 30lbs pulser assembly to help trapped air escape.  The automation process must not only replicate technician steps but also reduce cycle time while improving repeatability. 



The technical design effort wil include:
======

Kinematic and motion simulations to achieve precise positioning targeting cycle times of 15 minutes or less in 95% of cases. 

Integration of pressure sensors for real-time veriﬁcation of correct ﬁll cycles ensuring pressure stability of less than 0.1 psi/s drift for 60 seconds. 

Development of control logic to manage vacuum draw and compressed air pressurization steps reaching 30 psi with a tolerance of +/- 2 psi. 

Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to ensure structural integrity and feasibility under repeated use, validating a safety factor of 2.  Quantifying repeated cycling/ creep analysis of motor actuation lifting and lowering 30 lbs pulser assembly. 

Deﬁne success of trapped air removal via pressure measurements and validation test of at least 10 consecutive cycles without drift or failure.
